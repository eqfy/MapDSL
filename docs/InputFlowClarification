1. User creates an input

3. Kyle parses input into AST
- O(n)

2. Kyle validates the input which will include type checking, missing variable checks, etc.
- type checks are O(n), n being the length of the input
- missing variable checks are O(n) , n being the length of the input

3. Michael and Eric create a list of CreateStatement objects (according to interface spec) that are produced by the program
- time complexity is difficult to say here because of function calls and loops but I think its the following:
- O(n + (f*l) + (o*i))
--> n being the size of the input
--> f being the number of function calls
--> l being the length of each function call (including loops)
--> o being the number of loop calls (not in a function)
--> i being the number of times each loop runs

4. Kyle loops through the CreateStatement list and validates to ensure there are no overlapping streets
- takes 0(n) time while leveraging maps with O(1) access, n being the size of the CreateStatement list

5. Aidan and Maxwell are passed a list of CreateStatement objects.
- These objects are in order. So if a CREATE street is called BEFORE CREATE highway, then the highway should be ON TOP of the street. Other than that sort of scenario, the order should not matter.
- If its a street types, simply plot it on the map with the respective thickness/design you choose (as it will be different for streets vs bridges vs highways)
- If its a marker type, simply plot it on the map at the coordinates (either directly on top of the street, or slightly above it - doesnt matter where you put it,
as long as it accurately describes where the user intended it to be)
- takes O(n) time, n being the size of the CreateStatement list
