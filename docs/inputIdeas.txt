## Language Features
The language will enable users to create a diagram with:
- Components:
  - Streets:
    - Shape: straight, curved
    - Type: regular, highway, ramp, bridge
    - Name
    - Coordinates: startPos, endPos
  - Control elements:
    - Stop signs
    - Traffic lights
  - Transit features:
    - Bus stops
    - Train stops
- Variables:
  - Single components or a list of components
  - Allows mutation
- Control flow
  - Loops
  - If/Else
- Functions

[list of street names]

for each streetname
    CREATE street straight called streetname starting (x + 5, y + 5) to (x + 10, y + 10)
    y = y + 10;
    x = x + 10;





}

functionMap<functionName, functionNode>


straight northStreetName nwPosition nePosition

{
    type: straight
    name: northStreet
    start: x
    end: y
}

buildStreetOnMap(type, name, start, end) {
    googleMapsApi.render(type, name, start end);
}




// specs will describe to the user how to use this language!!


CREATE straight street called BIGsouthStreetName from sePosition of length 10 in the north direction;

[X,Y]
(X,Y) <-- better, associates with a pairing, rather than a list of values

to access the x coordinate of position kyleOnEarth, do kyleOnEarth.x <---- simple to understand
to access the y coordinate of position kyleOnEarth, do kyleOnEarth.y <---- simple to understand

to access the x coordinate of position kyleOnEarth, do kyleOnEarth[x] <---- simple to understand
to access the y coordinate of position kyleOnEarth, do kyleOnEarth[y] <---- simple to understand

X of kyleOnEarth
