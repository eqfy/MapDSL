Did you feel creating markers and streets with CREATE statements was straight forward?

Did you like having the DEFINITIONS block seperated from the CREATE block?

Did you find it difficult to declare new functions, constants, and variables?

Did you find it challenging to understand how loops work?

Was it weird to have nothing technically "returned" from the functions? Rather they are just a method of creating map elements?
