# Project1Group9

## Brief Project Description
In a general sense, our DSL will be used to create a simple map rendering from user input. 
This will be targeted towards city/street planners. It is also targeted to hardcore simulation game ethuthiastes.

## Language Features
The language will enable users to create a diagram with:
- Components:
  - Streets:
    - Shape: straight, curved
    - Direction: bi-direction, single direction
    - Type: regular, highway, ramp, bridge
    - Name
    - Coordinates: startPos, endPos
  - Control elements:
    - Stop signs
    - Traffic lights
  - Transit features:
    - Bus stops
    - Train stops
  - Inhabitant:
    - Car
    - Bus
    - Train
- Variables:
  - Single or Group together components
  - Allows mutation?
  - Allows explicit deep or shallow copy
- Control flow:
  - If/elif/else
  - Loops
- Functions:


## Feedback from TA Discussion
- Introduce variables/functions/loops for developing the map
- Simulations (Stretch Goal)


## Follow-up Features (Stretch Goals)
- Advanced road types (e.g. roundabouts)
- Buildings, parks, bodies of water
- Traffic Simulations


## Example Input
