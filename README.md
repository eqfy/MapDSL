# Project1Group9

## Brief Project Description
In a general sense, our DSL will be used to create a simple map rendering from user input. 
This will be targeted towards city/street planners.

## Language Features
The language will enable users to create a diagram with:
- Straight streets
- Curved streets
- Highways
- Stop signs
- Stop lights
- The ability to define functions
- The ability to define variables


## Feedback from TA Discussion
- Introduce variables/functions/loops for developing the map
- Simulations (Stretch Goal)


## Follow-up Features (Stretch Goals)
- Buildings
- Parks
- Roundabouts
- Traffic Simulations
- Loops for developing multiple streets at once
